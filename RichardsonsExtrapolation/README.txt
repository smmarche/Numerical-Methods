Consider f (x) = ln(x). I used Python to carry out a numerical experiment to demon-
strate the convergence orders of the central difference scheme (f ′(x) = 1
2h [f (x + h) − f (x − h)] + a2h2 + a4h4 + · · ·) and of the formula obtained by
Richardson’s extrapolation for approximating f ′(1) = 1.0. Then I plot the convergence histories on
the same figure, and show clearly the orders of convergence for h = 2−n where n = 2, · · · , 6.
